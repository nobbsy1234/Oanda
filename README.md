# Oanda

This is a simple python code to automate trades on Oanda. this is set to long eurusd and to long usdcad. These have a huge negative correlation meaning when one goes up the other goes down in price. The unit size is set to 1 unit feel free to update that to units that you want however I wouldn't go over 1/200 of the balance each trade which happens every 10 minutes which you can change to your own preferences. The script avoids 0600 to 0900am AEST to avoid high spreads. Remember trading is very risky don't risk more than you can afford to lose.
